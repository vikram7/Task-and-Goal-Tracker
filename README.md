This is a simple task list and goal tracker I wrote in Ruby on Sinatra with a PostgreSQL database. The front-end uses Foundation. It allows a user to create tasks that he or she wants to complete by a certain day of the week or those that can be categorized as "short term" (something a user wants completed soon, but doesn't have a specific target date) and "long term" (these are typically long term goals like "write a science fiction novel" or "become Prime Minister")

Here are a list of items that still need to be worked on:
- hide checkboxes
- create database of deleted items so the user can see what has been completed
- fix front end to fill screen
- fix issue related to empty submitted information
- adjust input method (forms) for a better UX
- add ability for multiple users and login

Some nice to haves:
- ability to text a task or pull tasks onto your phone
